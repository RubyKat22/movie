        <h2> Films are part of our society and are how we become human. It is how we escape reality. It is how we picture what could have been. Wondering the ‘what if’ or ‘how would this happen’. Movies can answer the questions of what would happen if we had magic? Or what if the bad guy won? Over time these questions would influence our world. Movies are a way to communicate to everyone through pictures and action.   </h2>

        <h2> It is where our fantasy can come to life for just a second we can believe that it's true. We can believe that the good guy will win in the end. We can learn the mistakes of our characters and either better ourselves or doom to repeat it. </h2>

        <h2> Movies can be a warning for the future telling us to make love not war. To accept our faults and bring us together. In the end either human or alien or even robots, we all are the same in some way. We all want to be happy, we want to succeed, we want to love, we want to grow into the best version of ourselves. </h2>
